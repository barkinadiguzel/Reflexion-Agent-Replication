# Reflexion-Agent-Replication
Reflexion-Agent-Replication is a modular framework that implements the Reflexion paradigm, enabling a language agent to improve through verbal self-reflection instead of weight updates. It realizes an iterative loop of action, evaluation, reflection, and memory-based policy refinement without model fine-tuning.
